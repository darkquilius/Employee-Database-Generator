    This tool lets a company easily keep track of their employees by keeping a database of them that can easily be manipulated. By giving a name, id#, email, role and other information subjunct to the employee's role, companies can take charge of their employees. As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails andGithub profiles
